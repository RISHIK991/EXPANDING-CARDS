# EXPANDING-CARDS
The Expanding Cards project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface with multiple cards that expand when clicked. The CSS provides smooth animations, and the JavaScript ensures that only one card is expanded at a time. This project enhances user experience by showcasing a clean and responsive design.
